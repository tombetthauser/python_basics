#remember you have to 'pip3 install pandas' and pip3 install ipython before working with these
#
# ipython is just an enhanced interface for working with data in python
#
# pandas is a library that allows us to easily work with a lot of different database formats like json etc
#
# when you enter into ipython you have to manually import pandas



# test
# PANDAS iPYTHON EXAMPLE
# creating a 'dataframe'
# creating a 'dataframe' --> df1=pandas.DataFrame([1,2,3],[4,5,6],columns=['a','b','c'],index=['one','two'])
# you can also create these dataframes with objects and use panda methods to access specific rows / columns etc (called pandas series) and get things like the mean or highest value etc
# in jupyter press esc and dd (d two times) to delete
# lookup more keyboard shortcuts under the help dropdown under keyboard shortcuts
