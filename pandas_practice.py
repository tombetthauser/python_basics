#remember you have to 'pip3 install pandas' and pip3 install ipython before working with these
\n#
\n# ipython is just an enhanced interface for working with data in python
\n#
\n# pandas is a library that allows us to easily work with a lot of different database formats like json etc
\n#
\n# when you enter into ipython you have to manually import pandas
