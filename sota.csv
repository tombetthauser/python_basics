Selection is made arbitrarily by city council advisory members who know absolutely 0 about art and make choices based on only what appeals to them personally which leads to inherent bias and just plain stupidity. Comments are made about work during these sessions which are completely irrelevant and the type of ignorance I encounter teaching art to naive 9 year olds. As a result, artists and imagery is selected which is not well rendered, irrelevant or staid, and people stay or get dumb and dumber and I see more mediocrity and ignorance in art and culture of which art is an expression.","For those who served as jurists, how much did racialized guilt play in your decision making criteria and process","","I want to see more attention paid to the role guilt and preconceived notions plays in the selection of art at all - ex., if one is over 60, it is often assumed the individual has had their opportunity and thus their work is dismissed and younger artists are emphasized. The assumption completely ignores women who may have been the sole provider for a family and thus unable to even begin to participate in opportunities, etc. Guilt plays a part in the tendencies seen of white people who make decisions based more in their own self-centered effort to relieve feelings of personal guilt vs. actual concern and desire to help under-represented groups of artists the result of which is more mediocrity and dumbed down art and literature and artists of color being patronized. Questioning jurists and art directors to suss this out should be emphasized.","","","","","",""
